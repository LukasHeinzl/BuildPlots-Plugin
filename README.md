# BuildPlotsPlugin
PaperMC-Plugin for build contests.
This is my first time using Kotlin and the first plugin I've written after a long time.

# It is still WIP!

Creates a plot for each player that logs on.
The players can only place, destroy or interact with blocks inside their plot.
Admins can switch between build and vote modes.

## Build mode
In build mode players can build on their plots.

## Vote mode
All players can award points to other player's plots.
